# GameVision
After the pandemic everyone has webcams lying around so we thought we could do something interesting with them. The ideea we came up with is to create a 2d fighting game that you control with your hands. But by that we don't mean that you use your hands to press  buttons on your keyboard, no, we mean that you use hand gestures, registered by your camera in order to control your character in the game.

In order to play the game you have to create an account. The user will register just using an username and a password. The application will keep track of your stats, and have a leaderboard so that you can compare yourself to other players.
